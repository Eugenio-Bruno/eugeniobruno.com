<p>The result was way nicer than I expected. I might even want to run this when debugging my own audio code!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In this blog post, I’ll demonstrate a technique that allows us to automatically generate audio files for each intermediate step in the signal chain of a piece of audio software. We will take a look at the results generated for a free synthesizer.</p>

<p>Digital audio is made up of signals consisting of thousands of consecutive samples - each sample is a single number, usually floats when processing audio and ints when storing it in a lossless file. These samples will get eventually filtered by an audio interface to generate an analog signal that will get passed to a speaker. After going through thousands of instructions, an audio callback might finally put a sample in the audio buffer, but that sample doesn’t mean anything by itself: you need to see a whole bunch of samples to understand what a signal is representing.</p>

<p>For this reason, singlestepping through an audio callback in a debugger isn’t going to be very useful in understanding what is going on. Every value you’re going to see in the registers window is meaningless. What you’re interested in is what signals are produced by what instructions. This is exactly what we can do by tracing the execution of the callback and logging all results of instructions on xmm register destinations, as we’ll see later. This particular synth uses SSE, and in particular we’re looking for xmm registers containing 4 floats each, but the same principles would be applicable for every datatype.</p>

<h3 id="what-a-synthesizer-looks-like-internally-kind-of">What a synthesizer looks like, internally, kind of</h3>

<p>Here’s a very simplified, unrealistic and just generally bad pseudocode example of what a software synthesizer might do to fill the audio callback. This is not meant to explain the way in which you would write a synthesizer, but why the tracing code we are going to write is supposed to work. This code would make for a very boring, very badly aliasing oscillator.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">callback</code> is going to be called by the soundcard or by an audio DAW tens of times per second.</p>

<p>What you will notice is that before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter_tick</code> can do anything, it needs data from the oscillator. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oscillator_tick</code> is always going to run before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter_tick</code>. If we go in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oscillator_tick</code>, we see that the oscillator phase is always going to be incremented before it’s wrapped, and it’s going to be wrapped before it’s used to get a sample from the wavetable.</p>

<p>A second thing to notice is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float oy = oscillator-&gt;wavetable(int_phase);</code> is called once per sample sequentially, which means that if we plotted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oy</code> we would see a signal. The same is true for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fy</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float fy = last_y * 0.9 + x * 0.1</code>. These signals would also be very easy to spot: in a virtual analog synth, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oy</code> would be a classic saw, triangle or square waveform, with sharp corners. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fy</code> would be the same wave, but with rounded corners.</p>

<p><strong>**UPDATE: BAD EXPLANATION AND CODE WARNING!** I did not know what I was doing when I wrote this. This is the <em>worst possible way</em> to implement this. This should be a intel pin or dynamorio binary instrumentation tool!</strong></p>

<p>I put the code in a github repo: <a href="https://github.com/eugenio-bruno/xmm_ida_trace_dsp">https://github.com/0xAC44/xmm_ida_trace_dsp</a></p>

<p>Disclaimer: this is a proof of concept I used to start analysing this particular software. The code is not polished and you’ll have to edit the files themselves every time you want to use them, in order to specify the parameters. I’ve just started playing with IDA and IDAPython, so I’m not sure about the best practices yet.</p>

<p>The first file, trace_tracer.py, is going to do the actual tracing. You first break where you want to start the tracing in the IDA debugger, manually edit the script to specify where you want to break and end the trace (again, sorry!), and then load it from the IDA file menu. I only tested this on IDA starter 7.1, as that’s the only version I own.</p>

<p>Here are some code snippets, so we can take a look at how this works:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TraceTracerHook</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DBG_Hooks</span><span class="p">):</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We define a subclass of DBG_Hooks. This will allow us to define callbacks that IDA will call when a debugging event is generated.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">    <span class="c1"># ... __init__ and other internal stuff
</span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">dbg_exception</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pid</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tid</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exc_code</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exc_can_cont</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exc_ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exc_info</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I was having problems with exceptions being thrown when I started writing this. I think that was because of a mistake I made in some other code, but I left this in anyway.</p>

<p>I’m going to add comments to this next snippet. This is the meat of the script:</p>

<p>Something to note is that this isn’t optimized at all. Since I have IDA for linux and I’m debugging windows VM with a remote debugger, I’m capped to less than a thousand steps per second anyway, but you might want to rewrite it to be more efficient if you need to use this for something that will run more than a couple hundred thousand instructions and you’re using a native debugger.</p>

<p>You then run from a terminal xmm_graph.py with python2 to generate the wav files. You can optionally also run it from IDA to generate a callgraph (but not the wav files). You will need to install pysndfile and numpy to run this script.</p>

<p>The wav files’ filenames are ordered by the time in the trace at which the instruction they refer to were first executed. For instance, if the instruction at address 0xf00b4r was first executed after 10000 thousands instructions recorded in the trace, its file name would be “10000.0xf00b4r.wav”. Since we’re dealing with xmm registers that are going to hold 4 float values, we actually use .0.wav, .1.wav, .2.wav and .3.wav, in case the application makes use of all of those values.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>Here’s some interesting stuff we can immediately see at a glance after running the scripts, no manual static or dynamic analysis needed:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/xmm_tracing_1/1.png" alt="saw" /></p>

<p>This is the first instruction where a sawtooth appears. The oscillators I selected in the software are indeed saw and triangle. This means that around there there must be an instruction that loads samples from some kind of a wavetable. There are some ripples, which means this shouldn’t be be a naive oscillator.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/xmm_tracing_1/2.png" alt="tri" /></p>

<p>Here’s the triangle oscillator popping up a bit later.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/xmm_tracing_1/3.png" alt="correction" /></p>

<p>This might be a correction signal to fix aliasing problems in an oscillator that is not bandlimited. Later in the trace there’s a saw signal that is exactly the sum of the first saw plus this signal.</p>

<p>This is just my assumption, as I don’t know enough about Digital Signal Processing to be sure, but for an example of a technique similar to this, see <a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=375517">polyblep</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/xmm_tracing_1/4.png" alt="pulse" /></p>

<p>Neat! That’s a pulse oscillator. I think the synth is using this to modulate the oscillators we saw before, but I don’t remember the exact patch I used to make these screenshots. This is another cool thing about this: we could vary one parameter at a time in the synth to see where the signals change, to quickly identify what everything in the code is.</p>
